    "1. **Bias & Invalid Coverage**: When you replace the true $Y_i$ with $f(X_i)$, your estimator $\\tilde\\theta_f$ will typically be **biased** (unless f is perfect), and as a result your CI will **under- or over-cover** the true parameter $\\theta^*$\n",
    "2. Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) fixes this by introducing a **rectifier** $\\Delta$ that captures the systematic error from using $f(X)$ in place of Y.  Concretely, for the simple case of estimating a mean, one defines$$\n",

    "In prediction-powered inference (PPI), the “rectifier set” $R$ is **not** the single-point estimate $\\hat\\Delta$ but rather a **confidence set** containing all plausible values of the rectifier $\\Delta$ given your labeled data.  Because $\\Delta$ is itself estimated with sampling noise, we construct $R$ (typically an interval) to capture that uncertainty.  In the mean‐estimation warm‐up, $\\Delta = \\mathbb{E}[\\,f(X)-Y\\,]$ is estimated by the empirical average $\\hat\\Delta = \\frac1n\\sum_i\\bigl(f(X_i)-Y_i\\bigr)$; the rectifier set is then\n",

    "**Quality Assurance in Imputation:** Use CP to generate _interval estimates_ when imputing missing values (e.g., in income, education level).\n",

    "    - this significance level restricts the frequency of errors that the algorithm is allowed to make;\n",
    "    - for example, significance of 0.1 means that the algorithm can make at more 10% erroneous predictons \n",
    "- To meet this requirement, the output is a predictions set, instead of a point prediction produced by standard supervised models\n",
    "    - for classification, this means that predictions are not a single class, for example `cat`, but instead, a set `{‘cat’, ‘dog'}`\n",
    "- depending on how good this underlying model is (how well it can discen between classes) and the specified significance level, these sets can be smaller or larger. \n",

    "CrossPPI requires only that predictions be measurable functions of the training folds—**no consistency** or **i.i.d. guarantees** on f are needed for validity.  Empirically, it often tightens intervals compared to classical PPI when the model generalizes well across folds\n"
