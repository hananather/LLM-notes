Artificial Intelligence is no longer optional. It has rapidly transitioned from a niche technology to a strategic imperative. The latest advancements have dramatically lowered the barriers to entry. Today, virtually any business can rapidly prototype and deploy impactful AI-driven solutions, even without deep technical expertise.

The strategic question isn't whether to use AI, but rather:
- "How do I identify the specific AI use cases that will deliver the highest ROI for my business?"

Answering this question strategically involves answering the following questions:
1. "What specific pain points can AI realistically address to significantly improve profitability or efficiency?"
2. "Do we have the right data—and enough of it—to support successful AI implementation?"
3. "How quickly can we see measurable results from adopting AI solutions?"
4. "What hidden risks or ethical challenges could emerge when integrating AI into our operations—and how can we manage them proactively?"


In this book, you'll find a clear framework designed to help you answer these critical questions and adapting foundation model which includes large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) to your unique business needs.

There are many different ways to incorporate AI into your business processes and workflows. Throughout the chapters, we'll explore different AI solutions and guide you in evaluating the most effective options  that best align with your specific goals.

To begin identifying the specific AI use cases that will deliver the highest ROI for your business you’ll need to systematically address the following critical questions:

- What specific business problems can AI realistically address? What specific inefficiencies should I prioritize solving with AI?
- How do I evalute AI use opportunities? 

- AI is not perfect, how can I set up guardrials to ennsure AI does go crazy?
- How can I detect AI hallucinations?
- Do I validate the qulaity of the outputs generate by LLMs?

- How do I actually tell LLMs to  actually do what I want them to do? (prompt Engineering)

- How can I give AI access to documents specific to my business? (RAG) So it it can utilize these documents. 
- How can I make sure sensitive information isn't leaked LLMs?
- How can I use AI in the context when I have sensitive information?
- What is an AI agent? How can my business use Agents? 
- How much data do I need to get started wiht using AI? What kinda of structure should the data be in so AI can enfficenlty use business data? How do I validate the quality of my data?

- How can I make the AI go faster, cheaper and more secure?
- How can I create feedback loop to improve my application continiously?

Online dicussions about using <for insert> LLMs inevitably produce comments from <better word than:folks> whos experiences have been disappoining. They often ask what they are doing wrong. How come some people are reporting such greats results when their own experimets have proved lacking?

Using LLMs to "solve real problems" (perhaps better word) is difficult and unintuitive. It takes significant effort to figure out the sharp and soft edges of using them in this way, and theres precious little guidance to help people figure out how to best apply them.

1. Set reasonable expectations
Ignore the "AGI" hype. LLMs are still fancy autocomplete. All they do is predict a sequence of tokens but it turns out many tasks are mostly about stringing tokens together in the right order, so they can be extremely useful for this provided you point them in the right direction. 

If you assume that this technology will implement your project (or automate your task) perfectly without you needing to exercise any of your skill you'll be quickly disappointed.

Instead use them to augment your abilities. My current favourite mental model is to think of them as  an over confident assistant who is lightining fast at looking things up, can churn out relevant suggestions at a moments notice and execute on tedious tasks without complaint. 

Over confident is important. They'll absolutely make mistakes. Sometimes subtle, sometimes huge. These mistakes can be deeply inhuman. If a human collaborator couldn't tell you the number of "r"s in the word strawberry or if claimed 3.11 > 3.9 you would instantly lose trust in them.
Don't fall into the trap of anthropomorphizing LLMs and assuming that failures which would discredit a human should discredit the machine in the sameway.

When working with LLMs you'll often find things they just cannot do. Make a note of these. These are useful lessons! They are also valuable examples to stash away for the future for when a a new model is relased. These examples can be valuable benchmarks to when stronger new model produces usable results for a task the previous models had been unable to handle.

2. Account for training cut-off dates
A crucial characteristic of any AI model is its training cut-off date. This is the date at which the data that the model was trained on stopped being collected. If businesses don’t use tools like web search or data integration to provide real-time updates, they risk making decisions based on outdated information. 

- Scenario: A small business owner asks AI about labor laws, tax regulations, or safety requirements. Since AI’s training data has a cutoff date, it may reference outdated laws, leading to unintentional violations, fines, or lawsuits.

- Scenario: A company integrates a chatbot for customer support. The AI still references old return policies, discontinued features, or outdated pricing, frustrating customers.


This brings us to the most important thing to understand when working with LLMs: 

3. Context is King

Most of the craft of getting good results out of an LLM comes down to managing context. "Context" is the text that is part of your current conversation. 

This context isn't just the prompt you have fed it. LLMs interactions usually take the form of conversations, and the context consists of every message from you and every reply from the LLM that exists in the current conversation thread.

When you start a new conversation you reset that context back to zero. This is important to know. Often the fix for a conversation that has stopped being useful is to wipe the slate clean and start again. 

New LLMs interfaces now go beyond just the conversation tools.  They allow you to pre populate the context with quite a large amount of text. The new web iterfaces and applications allow your to upload documents, import documents direclty from Google Docs or work with applications direclty on your computer like MS Excel. 

You can use the fact that previous replies are also part of the context to your advantage. For complex tasks try getting the LLM to write a simpler version first, check that and then iterate on solving to more sopisticated tasks. 

Its very useful to start a new chat by dumping all exisitng work to seed that context, then work on the LLM to modify it in someway. 

One great prompting techniqiues is to drop in several full examples relating to something I want to create, then prompting the LLM to use them as inspiration for a new project. This is especially useful for coding projects. 

4. Ask LLMs for options
Most projects start with some open questions: is this task possible? what are potential way it could be implemented? Which of those options are the best?

LLMs can quickly validate if a project or idea is even feasible within reasonable cost and resource constraints.
LLMs do a broad scan of solutions. For SMBs, that might be proven e-commerce platforms, CRM systems, or payroll tool. 
The training cut off is relevant here. Certain well established solutions may be the only ones the LLM knows in detail. If you’re looking for extremely new or emerging vendors, you might need to verify information outside the LLM.

Usually that’s OK  if you don’t want the latest but want the most stable and the one that has been around for long enough.

This workflow works well for prototyping the idea quickly. You can use an LLM to outline or even build quick playbooks or mini blueprints for how a new tool or workflow might look. This can give you a fast proof-of-concept before investing time and money. 


5. Tell them exaclty what to do
Once you have finished preliminary reserach, you want to shift modes entirely. 
In order to get LLMs to perform well defined tasks, your LLM usage needs to me much more authoritarian. You want to treat it like a digital intern, hired to type for you based on your detailed instuctions. 

Here’s a recent example:

	“Create a step-by-step New Employee Onboarding Guide that covers:
		1.	Our brand values and code of conduct.
	2.	Mandatory legal disclaimers, including safety protocols.
	3.	A quick reference to our existing HR policy document to confirm compliance.
	4.	An automated checklist that new hires can complete during their first week, with a final handoff to their manager.

	Include a safety check: if the final document is missing any legal disclaimers or references the wrong HR policy, raise an alert right away. Also, if the guide’s total word count goes beyond 2,000 words, I want an error so we can break it into more digestible sections.”

We could create this guide ouself, but it would easily take us twenty minutes or more to look up specific legal phrasing and double-check the brand guidelines. Our AI assistant can produce a near-finished version in about thirty seconds.

LLMs respond extremely well to structured prompts—like the one above—where we act as the “blueprint” creator, and the AI does the heavy lifting of writing the actual content.

You can follow up with: “Now generate a short orientation video script based on this guide.” Again, we are controlling the tools (script format, tone, essential bullet points) while the LLM saves us the effort of typing out every detail floating in our head.

It can be very valuable  to kleep track of successful prompting strategies and share them with your team to improve everyone's efficiency.

6. You have to validate what it writes!

The one thing you absolutely cannot outsource entirely to an AI assistant is verifying the content it produces. Even if the AI drafts a marketing campaign, you are ultimately responsible for ensuring the message reflects your brand, adheres to legal guidelines, and resonates with customers. If you haven’t reviewed and tested that campaign—by checking hyperlinks, verifying facts, and confirming brand consistency—it’s not truly ready to send out.

You need to invest time into building a solid final review process. This may not be glamorous work, but it has always been critical to rolling out successful marketing efforts—whether or not an AI is involved.

7. Don't be afraid to prompt agian

If you don't like what an LLM as written, they'll never complain at being told to re-write it it again. The output an LLM produces first time is rarely the final draft. But they can re-type it dozens of times for you without ever getting fustrated or bored.

Occasionally you can get a great results on your first prompt (the more frequently you practice prompting) but you should expect to need at least a few follow ups.

This seems to be one of the key tricks people miss. A bad initial result ins't a failure, its a starting point to push the mdoel in the direction of the thing you actually want. 


8. Be ready for the human to take over

LLMs are no replacement for human intution and experience. It many instances its faster to step in and finish the project rather than keep on trying to get there with prompts. Don’t expect AI to do absolutely everything. Sometimes the LLM gets stuck or offers outdated instructions. In those moments, your experience and intuition will save you time.


9. The Biggest Advantage Is Speed of Creation

LLMs allow employees to execute ideas faster which means I can implement more of them, which mean employees can learn even more. LLMs compress weeks of work into hours by automating repetitive. Teams can now test five ideas in the time it used to take to debate one in meetings. 



10. AI amplify existing expertise 
Your business acumen determines the quality of AI outputs. The greatest competitive advantage comes from combining AI with your unique market insights

Answering Questions About Existing Documents

You can dump your policy manuals, sales scripts, or older campaign drafts into an AI model with a large context window and ask, “What’s the main difference between the 2023 and 2024 discount terms?” or “Which bullet points did we use in last summer’s social ads?” Even if it occasionally misreads a line, that’s typically quicker than manually slogging through a 50-page PDF or rummaging through email archives.
