      "   - The DATA step is named WORK.SALES_SUMMARY, meaning the output dataset will reside in the SAS WORK library.\n",
      "   - The SET statement reads records from an existing dataset named WORK.MONTHLY_SALES.\n",
      "   - The BY statement specifies that the input data is already sorted (or indexed) by PRODUCT_CATEGORY and REGION. This enables the use of FIRST. and LAST. temporary variables for each group defined by these variables.\n",
      "   - The RETAIN statement initializes and keeps the value of the variable TOTAL_SALES_CATEGORY across data step iterations. It is set to 0 initially.\n",
      "   - The IF FIRST.REGION condition resets the TOTAL_SALES_CATEGORY to 0 whenever a new REGION group starts. Note that this happens even though the BY statement includes PRODUCT_CATEGORY; the code is aggregating by REGION within each PRODUCT_CATEGORY.\n",
