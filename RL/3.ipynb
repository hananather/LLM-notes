    "#  Dynamic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic Programming (DP) methods solve reinforcement learning problems when we have a perfect model of the environment (known states, actions, transition probabilities, and rewards). DP is essentially planning: using Bellman equations to compute value functions and optimal policies. While not used directly in model-free learning, DP lays the groundwork for understanding value functions and optimality.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Key ideas:\n",
    "- Policy Evaluation: Compute the value function $v_{\\pi}(s)$ for a given policy π (prediction with a model).\n",
    "- Policy Improvement: Given value function $v_{\\pi}$, improve the policy by acting greedily w.r.t. those values.\n",
    "- Policy Iteration: Iteratively alternate evaluation and improvement until convergence to an optimal policy\n",
    "- Value Iteration: A streamlined approach that combines evaluation and improvement in one step (update values towards optimality directly)\n",

    "We'll demonstrate these in a simple Grid World environment.\n",

    "## Grid World Environment\n",
    "Consider a 4x4 grid (like a little board game). The agent starts in some cell and can move up, down, left, or right:\n",
    "- Some cells are terminal states (once reached, the episode ends).\n",
    "- For simplicity, let's use the top-left (0,0) and bottom-right (3,3) as terminal states. The goal could be to reach the bottom-right corner.\n",
    "- Each step gives a reward of -1 (so there's a penalty per move, which encourages finding the shortest path to a terminal).\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup is similar to the example in Sutton & Barto (Gridworld), where the objective is to reach a goal in as few steps as possible (minimize cost).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define the environment dynamics:\n",
    "- States: (i,j) grid positions, i,j ∈ {0,1,2,3}. Two terminal states: (0,0) and (3,3).\n",
    "- Actions: up, down, left, right.\n",
    "- Transition: deterministic moves, but if an action would take the agent off-grid, it remains in the same state.\n",
    "- Reward: -1 for each action (except maybe 0 at terminal since episode ends there).\n",
    "- Discount factor γ = 1 (we'll treat it as an episodic task with finite horizon implicitly, focusing on minimizing steps).\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll represent the value function as a 4x4 matrix for convenience.\n",

For example, if you use `np.argmax(policy[s])` to get the current action, and the actions list is `[0, 1, 2, 3]`, but the policy is defined as a dictionary with arbitrary key order like `{3: 0.25, 1: 0.25, 0: 0.25, 2: 0.25}`, then the action will be incorrect since dictionaries don't maintain order.\n",
