    "Understanding reinforcement learning requires a solid grasp of probability and randomness. In this first notebook, we’ll explore basic probability concepts through simple Python simulations. By the end, you should feel comfortable drawing samples from different probability distributions and understanding concepts like expected value and variance in a hands-on way.\n",
